In this challenge, we start by fetching data from a github web API to get in the end an array wich contains informations about US cities each in one element, we add an input event on the form, we get user input, and we loop over the array and show up every element that contains the user input in it's city or state name, by printing out a string containing the city name, the state name and the population, and highlighting that substring entered by the user in that string.
